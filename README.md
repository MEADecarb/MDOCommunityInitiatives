# MDO Community Initiatives

Welcome to the MDO Community Initiatives repository! This project is dedicated to mapping and showcasing various community initiatives across the Maryland region, focusing on sustainability, social equity, and resilience. The map provides a visual representation of the resources and services offered by different organizations, helping to connect communities and foster collaboration.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a comprehensive map that highlights the diverse initiatives available in the MDO region. This map can be used by community members, organizations, and policymakers to identify resources, build partnerships, and enhance the impact of local initiatives.

### Features

- **Interactive Map**: Explore the interactive map to find out more about each initiative. The map displays the locations and descriptions of various organizations, allowing users to easily access the information they need.
- **Community Resources**: The map includes information on a wide range of resources and services, such as workshops, training sessions, advocacy groups, and more.
- **Collaboration**: By visualizing these initiatives, the project aims to encourage collaboration and connections between different organizations and communities in the region.
